    <strong>Colonial Remnants – Garrison Cemetery &amp; Scott’s Bungalow</strong>
    <p>There are many buildings and structures in Srirangapatna that date back to Colonial times. Visit the Garrison Cemetery where the British fallen of the last battle with Tipu Sultan were laid to rest. The cemetery is located on the banks of the Kaveri River and also includes graves of 80 officers from the Swiss Regiment de Meuron.</p>
    <p>Scott’s Bungalow is another colonial landmark of the town. A place that has invited some local myths, the bungalow was the residence of a British officer who faced tragedy and disappeared from the town. Enjoy a visit to this structure, which is nestled amidst a wooded area. Lord Harris’ House is another old colonial bungalow that is a reminder of Srirangapatna’s multi-layered heritage.</p>
