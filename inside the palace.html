    <p>The architectural style of domes of the palace is commonly described as Indo-Saracenic, with blends of the Hindu, Mughal, Rajput, and Gothic styles. It is a three-story stone structure with marble domes, and has a 145-foot five-story tower. The palace is surrounded by a large garden. The entrance gate and arch hold the emblem and coat of arms of the kingdom of Mysore, around which is written the kingdom's motto in Sanskrit</p>
    <p>The main complex is 245 Ft in length and also 156 Ft in width. There are fire extinguishing machines located in all parts of the palace in order to prevent any fires.<sup id="cite_ref-Naveen_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Naveen-5"></a></sup> The palace has three entrances: the East Gate (the front gate, opened only during the <a href="/wiki/Navrati" class="mw-redirect" title="Navrati">Dasara</a> and for dignitaries), the South Entrance (for public), and the West Entrance (usually opened only during the <a href="/wiki/Navratri" class="mw-redirect" title="Navratri">Dasara</a>).
    </p>
    <p>The three-story stone building of a fine grey granite with deep pink marble domes has a facade with several expansive arches and two smaller ones flanking the central arch, which is supported by tall pillars. Above the central arch is a sculpture of <a href="/wiki/Gajalakshmi" title="Gajalakshmi">Gajalakshmi</a>, the Goddess of wealth, prosperity, fortune, and abundance with her elephants. There are three major exclusive temple buildings within the Old Fort, and about 18 inside the palace heart building. The palace was built adjacent to the even older <a href="/wiki/Parakala_Mutt" class="mw-redirect" title="Parakala Mutt">Parakala Mutt</a> headquarters, whose leaders have remained the <i>rajagurus</i> (royal teacher and guide) of Mysore kings. The kings of Mysore were devotees of Goddess Chamundi, hence the palace's facing the Chamundi Hills.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"></a></sup>
