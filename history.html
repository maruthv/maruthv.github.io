    <p>The area where the palace is now located originally belonged to Reverend J Garrett, who was a school principal in the cantonment town. &nbsp;It was purchased in 1873 by the guardians of Chamaraja Wadiyar and construction began in 1874. John Cameron, the person behind Lalbagh was enrolled for the landscaping of the palace and surrounding areas.

    <p>The Bangalore Palace is intertwined with the history of the city. Its European architecture is a reminder of the colonial legacy of the town while its opulence also showcases the riches of the local kings. The expansive Palace Grounds around it were once a famed venue for international music acts, so this location has an important place in Bangaloreâ€™s contemporary culture too. A visit to the Palace is a must, a step back in time and away from the modern landscape that prevails everywhere else.</p>
